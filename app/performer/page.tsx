    <p>
      <span className="font-bold text-neutral-200">Blake Montgomery</span> began
      his career in Chicago directing ensemble clown theater and performing with
      a variety of non-naturalistic Chicago theaters, most notably Redmoon with
      whom he collaborated for more than a decade. In 2005, Montgomery founded
      The Building Stage, a theater company and performance space, where he
      served as Artistic Director until its closing in 2013. The company was
      known for its ensemble-devised, director-driven creations, particularly in
      literary adaptations like their Jeff Award-winning{" "}
      <span className="italic">Moby-Dick</span> and the poetic, clown-inspired{" "}
      <span className="italic">Dawn, Quixote</span>. Montgomery&apos;s artistic
      approach draws on his training at the Ã‰cole Jacques Lecoq, the
      Dell&apos;Arte School of Physical Theater, and Middlebury College. A
      member of Actors&apos; Equity, his performances in Chicago include work
      with The House Theatre, The Hypocrites, Remy Bumppo Theatre Company, Court
      Theatre, Chicago Shakespeare, Steppenwolf, and Writers Theatre.
