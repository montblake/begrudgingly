                Blake Montgomery

              began his career in Chicago directing ensemble clown theater and
              performing with a variety of non-naturalistic Chicago theaters,
              most notably Redmoon with whom he collaborated for more than a
              decade. In 2005, Montgomery founded The Building Stage, a theater
              company and performance space, where he served as Artistic
              Director until its closing in 2013. The company was known for its
              ensemble-devised, director-driven creations, particularly in
              literary adaptations like their Jeff Award-winning{" "}
              <span className="italic">Moby-Dick</span> and the poetic,
              clown-inspired <span className="italic">Dawn, Quixote</span>.
              Montgomery&apos;s artistic approach draws on his training at the
              Ã‰cole Jacques Lecoq, the Dell&apos;Arte School of Physical
              Theater, and Middlebury College. A member of Actors&apos; Equity,
              his performances in Chicago include work with The House Theatre,
              The Hypocrites, Remy Bumppo Theatre Company, Court Theatre,
              Chicago Shakespeare, Steppenwolf, and Writers Theatre.
