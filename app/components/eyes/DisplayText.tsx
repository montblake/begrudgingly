But what if Dickens never stopped? What if he's bound to repeat his reading of A Christmas Carol every Decemberâ€”year after year, century after century?

        Now, over 200 years old and tired of his own creation, Dickens has a new idea. Instead of performing his classic tale yet again, he plans to host Charles Dickens's First Annual Holiday Party. But as we all know, holiday spirits have a way of interfering with even the best-laid plans. Through humor, unexpected twists, and intimate moments, Dickens may just rediscover the beauty in his work and the joy of sharing it with an audience, one more time."
