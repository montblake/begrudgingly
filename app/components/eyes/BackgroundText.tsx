      In 1853, ten years after having dashed off his surprisingly successful
      holiday story, &apos;A Christmas Carol&apos;, Charles Dickens gave his
      first public reading of the work. The effort was so well received, as well
      as providing much needed cash, that Dickens continued to perform these
      celebrated readings for the rest of his life. Never one to let the facts
      get in the way of a good story, creator Blake Montgomery conflates the
      enduring popularity of the ubiquitous holiday &apos;Christmas Carol&apos;
      with Dickens&apos;s personal readings and imagines that reports of the
      author&apos;s death were greatly exaggerated. And so, year after year,
      each and every December, not only do theaters around the globe produce
      adaptations of his famous book but Dickens himself is brought back to the
      stage to continue his tradition of solo readings ad infinitum. Now over
      200 years old, Dickens has reached a breaking point and unbeknownst to
      theater management, he will not be performing his show this evening.
      Instead, he has planned something entirely new, something he is calling,
      &quot;Charles Dickens&apos;s First Annual Holiday Party.&quot; Perhaps
      Dickens will get his wish. Or, perhaps, the Spirits of Christmas might
      intervene and force him to perform his worn-out tale once again, in the
      course of which, due to some highly irregular and ridiculous occurrence,
      he might see his work in a new light, rediscovering its beauty and his
      passion while, along the way, forging the kind of intimate, joyful
      connection with the audience he had hoped would come from hosting a party
      in the first place.
