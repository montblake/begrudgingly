              Blake Montgomery began his career in Chicago directing ensemble
              clown theater and performing with a variety of non-naturalistic
              Chicago theaters, most notably Redmoon with whom he collaborated
              for over a decade. In 2005, Montgomery founded The Building Stage,
              a theater company and performance space, where he served as
              Artistic Director until its closing in 2013. The company was known
              for its ensemble-devised, director-driven creations, particularly
              in literary adaptations like their Jeff Award-winning{" "}
              <span className="italic">Moby-Dick</span> and the poetic,
              clown-inspired <span className="italic">Dawn, Quixote</span>.
              Montgomery&apos;s artistic approach draws on his training at the
              Ã‰cole Jacques Lecoq, the Dell&apos;Arte School of Physical
              Theater, and Middlebury College. A member of Actors&apos; Equity,
              his performances in Chicago include work with The House Theatre,
              Hypocrites, Remy Bumppo, Court Theatre, Chicago Shakespeare,
              Steppenwolf, and Writers Theatre.
