            Blake Montgomery (Dickens) began his career in Chicago directing
            ensemble clown theater and performing with a variety of
            non-naturalistic Chicago theaters, most notably Redmoon with whom he
            collaborated for more than a decade. In 2005, Montgomery founded The
            Building Stage, a theater company and performance space, where he
            served as Artistic Director until its closing in 2013. The company
            was known for its ensemble-devised, director-driven creations,
            particularly in literary adaptations like their Jeff Award-winning
            Moby-Dick and the poetic, clown-inspired Dawn, Quixote. Montgomery's
            artistic approach draws on his training at the École Jacques Lecoq,
            the Dell'Arte School of Physical Theater, and Middlebury College. A
            member of Actors' Equity, his performances in Chicago include work
            with The House Theatre, The Hypocrites, Remy Bumppo Theatre Company,
            Court Theatre, Chicago Shakespeare, Steppenwolf, and Writers
            Theatre. Honoring the Past, Present, and Future: this performance is
            dedicated to Anne, Lauren, and Bodie.
