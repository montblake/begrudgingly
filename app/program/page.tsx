              Blake Montgomery (Dickens, Creator)
            </span>{" "}
            began his career in Chicago directing ensemble clown theater and
            performing with a variety of non-naturalistic Chicago theaters, most
            notably Redmoon with whom he collaborated for more than a decade. In
            2005, Montgomery founded The Building Stage, a theater company and
            performance space, where he served as Artistic Director until its
            closing in 2013. The company was known for its ensemble-devised,
            director-driven creations, particularly in literary adaptations like
            their Jeff Award-winning <span className="italic">Moby-Dick</span>{" "}
            and the poetic, clown-inspired{" "}
            <span className="italic">Dawn, Quixote</span>. Montgomery&apos;s
            artistic approach draws on his training at the École Jacques Lecoq,
            the Dell&apos;Arte School of Physical Theater, and Middlebury
            College. A member of Actors&apos; Equity, his performances in
            Chicago include work with The House Theatre, The Hypocrites, Remy
            Bumppo Theatre Company, Court Theatre, Chicago Shakespeare,
            Steppenwolf, and Writers Theatre. Honoring the Past, Present, and
            Future: this performance is dedicated to Anne, Lauren, and Bodie.
